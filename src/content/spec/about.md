# About

Hi! I'm AsakawaReikiri, a Software Engineer.

I enjoy turning cool ideas into real.I have a strong passion for software development and love building tools, experimenting with new technologies, and finding ways to improve development efficiency—for myself and for others. This blog is where I write and share my thoughts, projects, and experiences along the way.

Outside of coding, I'm interested in photography and traveling, and I post photos from my trips on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/asakawareikiri/). I also love anime, movies, and TV series.

If you happen to speak Chinese, I have a Chinese-only [X](https://x.com/YasakaKanoko) where I share my thoughts more casually. If you'd like to chat, let's have some coffee or work together, feel free to reach out.
